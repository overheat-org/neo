<h1 align="center">Neo</h1>
<p align="center"><strong>Statically typed, Multi-transpilable and Runtimeless programming language</strong></p>

Neo is what I call a "multi-transpilable" and "runtimeless" programming language. It is designed to be highly flexible, allowing code to be transpiled into many other languages ​​via a transpilation API. With Neo, you can write your code in a single language and transform it into efficient implementations on multiple platforms and programming languages, without the need for a dedicated runtime.

## Getting Started
Neo is still in the early stages of development. Features and functionality are being actively developed, and the language is not yet feature-complete. Expect frequent updates as the project progresses, and contributions or feedback are welcome.
